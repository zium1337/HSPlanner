A desktop build planner for **Hero Siege** — a calculator for the talent tree, gear, stats, and skills, with optional read/write support for the game's save files.

---

## Features

- [ ] **Talent tree** *(only layout, passives will be added later)* — interactive pan/zoom graph view with auto-pathfinding, path preview on hover, and reset
- [ ] **Skills and sub-skills** *(currently stormweaver was added)* — point allocation that respects skill prerequisites and per-level caps
- [ ] **Gear** *(around 70% done)* — slots for weapons, armor, charms, jewelry with sockets (gems/runes) and runeword detection
- [x] **Affixes** — add affixes with tier and adjustable roll
- [x] **Stats** — aggregated bonuses from tree, gear, attributes, and runewords
- [x] **Custom stats** — free-text user-entered stats for things outside the data model
- [x] **Notes** — sanitized WYSIWYG editor (per build), preserved across share links
- [x] **Builds menu** — multiple saved builds, each with multiple profiles
- [x] **Share** — export the entire build to a compressed URL (lz-string)
- [ ] **Save File** *(broken)* — read and edit `.hss` Hero Siege save files (level, hero level, class, hardcore, wormhole, chaos towers)
- [x] **Update check** — opt-in update check via GitHub Releases

## Runtime requirements (prebuilt app)

Download the installer / binary for your platform from Releases. The app is self-contained — end users do not need Node or Rust installed.

| Platform | Required component |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 | WebView2 Runtime (preinstalled on Win11; the installer pulls it on Win10) |
| macOS 10.15+ | None — WebKit is built into the OS |
| Linux (x86_64) | `webkit2gtk-4.1`, `libssl`, standard GTK runtime libraries |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Save File** feature needs access to the Hero Siege save folder (typically `%APPDATA%/Hero Siege/SaveFiles` on Windows). You pick the folder in the UI — the app does not read anything outside it.

| **npm** | 10.x (ships with Node 20+) | Package manager |
| **Rust toolchain** | `rustup` with `stable` (≥ 1.77) | Tauri backend |
| **Tauri prerequisites** | see below per OS | Linker, system libraries |

### Tauri — system prerequisites

**Windows**
- Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (workload "Desktop development with C++")
- WebView2 Runtime (only needed on Win10; Win11 has it preinstalled)

**macOS (only for development purpose because game doesn't support macos)**
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
